# Athens Week project
# 2nd Year of Engineering at Télécom Paris (2018-2019) 

<b>Abstract</b>
During the Athens week and thanks to the subject From Complexity to Intelligence (TPT37),I was
introduced to the theory of complexity and its relation with machine learning.In the lab of Machine
Learning of this subject the idea of choosing the optimal number of clusters with global complexity
was well introduced and explained.Thus,since I already worked with k-means in several projects I
have always used the elbow method to determine this hyper-parameter.In this short report I will
explain and compare these two methods.
